# Jan Jelinek – Loop-finding-jazz-records
If I remember correctly I discovered Jan Jelinek as an artist when I stumbled across [this video](https://shft.com/watch/epic-earth-time-lapse-from-space/). The warm sounds and dense rhythms immediately got my attention. As the album title suggests the sounds where solely created by sampling jazz records. I think this makes for a great part of the quality of this album.  I have to admit that I was quite surprised that this album does not have a higher rating on rym since (imho) it is one of a kind. But then again rym users don't seem to be too crazy about electronic music in general.

Also check out his alteregos [Farben](/artist/farben) and [Gramm](/artist/gramm).
