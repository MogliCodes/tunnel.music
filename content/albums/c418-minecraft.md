# C418 – Minecraft: Volume Alpha
I never really was into gaming and I think I heart about Minecraft the first time from a developer's point of view. Somehow I found out about the soundtrack of this game. And man oh man, did I love it. It is definitely one of my favourite ambient albums of all time!
