# Brian Eno – Ambient 1: Music for Airports

Another non-debatable classic. Honestly, I cannot really tell a lot about this album, because the first track already is so hypnotising that I forget everything that happens afterwards. Just listen and enjoy the repetitive Piano and Synthesizer melodies.
