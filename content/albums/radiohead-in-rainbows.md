# Radiohead – In Rainbows
Radiohead. One of my, if not my absolutely favourite band. In Rainbows is one of those albums where I wouldn't say it is technically or musically the best album in a band's discography, but it is the most re-listenable. It's just so smooth how one song blends into the next. I have had a lot of different phases with this album and different favourite tracks. It used to be Reckoner, but right now I am feeling mostly House of Cards. It has such a calm and beautiful atmosphere.
