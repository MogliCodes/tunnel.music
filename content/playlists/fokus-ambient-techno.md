# FOKUS: Ambient Techno
During the development of this platform I needed drive and focus. Around that time I also re-discovered an album by Marcel Fengler for me. This kickstarted this playist.

I really cannot get enough of driving ambient techno, although I am quite picky concerning sound design and style. But especially Fengler's track Jaz fully delivers in these regards. I could go on and talk about this song all day and night. It is just so beautiful.
