It was one of the albums that introduced me to Minimal Techno, and Techno as a whole. For me it's kind of hard to listen to this, because it is so nostalgically charged that it almost feels too overwhelming. But nonetheless, there some hypnotic and spacy tunes on here. Unfortunately my favourite song 'Florac' is not on the vinyl edition. Real bummer. If you like a more rough Minimal Techno sound, you might like his debug 'Diamond Daze'."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:albums:pantha-du-prince-this-bliss.md","_source":"content","_file":"albums/pantha-du-prince-this-bliss.md","_stem":"albums/pantha-du-prince-this-bliss","_extension":"md"}]
